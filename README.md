# Nonogram


Inspired by the game nonogram, I wrote my first personal programming project in Python, described as a picture logic puzzle. 
Consists of grids that must be either colored or left blank according to numbers along the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.

Nonogram are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete omography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of"4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets.
